# SRM0-NETWORK-CLASS
### This Repository is an implementation of a paper written by one of my professors at UF. It is a learning algorithm to learn precise spike trains given random weights and arbitrary number of nodes. 
### This is a machine learning framework for learning spike arrival times with biologically realistic neurons.
